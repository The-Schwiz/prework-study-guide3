# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Created to help categorize and house notes for easy access to information pertaining to the content of the Prework associated with coding bootcamp. 

The project was built to help stay on top of information presented in coding bootcamp. 

It solves the problem of information being fragmented across multiple sources and allows me to keep a central repository of all pertinent notes. 

In doing this, I learned the basics of GitHub, HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

Each section of the webpage contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
